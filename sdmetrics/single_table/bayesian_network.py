        Real data and synthetic data must be passed as ``pandas.DataFrame`` instances
        and ``metadata`` as a ``Table`` metadata ``dict`` representation.

        If no ``metadata`` is given, one will be built from the values observed

        entry within the ``metadata`` dict, it is passed to the underlying BayesianNetwork

        algorithm.

        ``structure`` can be passed as either a tuple of tuples representing only the
        network structure or as a ``dict`` representing a full serialization of a previously
        fitted ``BayesianNetwork``. In the later scenario, only the ``structure`` will be
