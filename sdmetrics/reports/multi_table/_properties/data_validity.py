    This property computes, at base, whether each column contains valid data.
    The metric is based on the type data in each column.
    A metric score is computed column-wise and the final score is the average over all columns.
    The BoundaryAdherence metric is used for numerical and datetime columns, the CategoryAdherence
    is used for categorical and boolean columns and the KeyUniqueness for primary and
    alternate keys. The other column types are ignored by this property.
